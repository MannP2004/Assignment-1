       <h1>Hi, Respected sir</h1>
       <h2>Hi, my fellow classmates</h2>
       <p>Hey, hey
        Bye bye bye, bye bye
        Bye bye
        I'm doing this tonight
        You're probably gonna start a fight
        I know this can't be right
        Hey baby come on
        I loved you endlessly
        When you weren't there for me
        So now it's time to leave and make it alone
        I know that I can't take no more
        It ain't no lie
        I want to see you out that door
        Baby bye bye bye
        Don't want to be a fool for you
        Just another player in your game for two
        You may hate me but it ain't no lie
        Baby bye bye bye
        Bye bye
        Don't really want to make it tough
        I just want to tell you that I've had enough
        It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
        Baby bye bye bye
        You just hit me with the truth
        Now girl you're more than welcome to
        So give me one good reason
        Baby come on
        I've lived for you and me
        And now I really come to see
        That life would be much better once you're gone
        I know that I can't take no more
        It ain't no lie
        I want to see you out that door
        Baby bye bye bye
        Don't want to be a fool for you
        Just another player in your game for two
        You may hate me but it ain't no lie
        Baby bye bye bye
        Bye bye
        Don't really want to make it tough
        I just want to tell you that I've had enough
        Might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
        Baby bye bye bye
        I'm giving up I know for sure
        I don't' want to be the reason for your love no more
        Bye bye
        I'm checking out, I'm signing off
        I don't want to be the loser, and I've had enough
        I don't want to be your fool in this game for two
        So I'm leaving you behind
        (Bye bye bye)
        I don't want to make it tough
        (Make it tough)
        But I've had enough
        And it ain't no lie
        Don't want to be a fool for you
        Just another player in your game for two
        I don't want to be your fool
        But it ain't no lie
        Baby bye bye bye
        Bye bye
        Don't really want to make it tough
        I just want to tell you that I've had enough
